# Arduino-based AIDA64 Indicator

*Codename: EPSILON ε*
Just an attempt after the Great Depression.

### Hardware dependency
- An HD44780-based LCD screen with 4 rows, 20 columns, and I²C input support generated by a PCF8574 bridge
- An Arduino Uno (or its equivalents)

### Software dependency
- AIDA64, inspired by [cokesu](http://www.51hei.com/bbs/dpj-188021-1.html)
- Library [LiquidCrystal_I2C](https://github.com/enjoyneering/LiquidCrystal_I2C)
- Platform IO on the Visual Studio Code -- Just import this repo and run.

### Future attempts
- Try utilizing FreeRTOS.
- Add a clock on it.
- Add some environment-tracking sensors on it.
