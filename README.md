# Arduino-based AIDA64 Indicator

*Codename: EPSILON ε*  
Just an attempt after the Great Depression.  
Want documentation in Chinese? Sorry but I have no patience on it. 🎃(需要中文翻译？别问，问就是懒得整。)

### Hardware dependency
- An HD44780-based LCD screen with 4 rows, 20 columns, and I²C input support generated by a PCF8574 bridge
- An Arduino Uno (or its equivalents)

### Software dependency
- AIDA64, inspired by [cokesu](http://www.51hei.com/bbs/dpj-188021-1.html)
- Library [LiquidCrystal_I2C](https://github.com/enjoyneering/LiquidCrystal_I2C)
- Platform IO on the Visual Studio Code

### Technical notes
Improvements over *cokesu*'s solution have been made, including:
- Up to 9 items can be transfered. Please see the chart below.
- The ending pattern `E` has been removed, to suffice the 64-byte limit on the Serial's buffer (defined by `Arduino.h`).
- The Serial is configured to run on 115200 bps -- the default 9600 bps is sufficient enough, though.

Data sent by AIDA64 should look like this:
```
m 3901 M 14728 T 39 
B 36 b 48 p 100.86  
f 1530 t 45 P 39.50

```
***Note:*** 
- All lines (except the last one) can carry UP TO 19 patterns; 
- At least one space MUST be reserved between each items.

Then, on the LCD 2004 screen, they will look like this:
```
G:45℃ 1530√ 100.86W
C:39℃ 39.50W
Mem:14728  VRAM:3901
MOS:36℃    SSD:48℃
```

### Future attempts
- Utilize FreeRTOS.
- Add a clock on it.
- Add some environment-tracking sensors on it.
